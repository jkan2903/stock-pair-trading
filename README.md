# Stock Pair Trading with Min-Hash Signatures

## Overview

This project identifies pairs of stocks with similar price movement patterns based on a target similarity threshold. Using a simple method of comparing changes in the closing prices of a collection of NASDAQ stocks, the system applies the **Min-Hash algorithm** to generate candidate pairs efficiently. This lightweight approach can be adapted to other domains requiring pattern-based similarity detection.
